"""A small, human-readable activity log (Law 8: always clear what's happening).

Plain-language events — "Pushed content to 2 displays", "Renamed to Lobby" — are
appended to a capped JSON file in the data dir so an operator can see what the
device has been doing from the health screen, without reading the systemd
journal. This is a friendly activity feed, not a security audit log: it records
what happened, never secrets, passwords, or keys.
