"""Promoting a display into a controller.

A controller needs LibreOffice + poppler to turn PowerPoint files into images.
The app runs sandboxed (systemd NoNewPrivileges), so it cannot install packages
itself. Instead, when a device is switched to the controller role it drops a
small request file in the data dir; a root-owned systemd path unit (installed by
install.sh) notices the file, installs one fixed set of packages, and writes a
status file the app reads back. The privileged work stays outside the sandbox
and is limited to that one package set — the app can never run arbitrary
commands as root.
