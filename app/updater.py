"""Self-update: ask the privileged helper to install a new app release.

The app is sandboxed and can't replace its own files, so "Update now" just drops
a request file in the data dir. A root-owned path unit (installed by install.sh)
builds the new version into its own release dir, swaps the /opt/signage symlink to
it atomically, restarts, and waits for /healthz — rolling the symlink back to the
previous release if the new one doesn't come up healthy. The app only ever writes
the request and reads the status the helper writes back, so a bad update can never
wedge the device.
